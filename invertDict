# FEEDBACK: DO NOT RUSH THROUGH THINGS. TAKE YOUR TIME TO TAKE A DEEP BREATH, UNDERSTAND MY OWN SOLUTION, MAKE A FRAMEWORK IN MY HEAD,
# 

# EXAMPLE: 1 + 1
# IN MY HEAD, I SHOULD KNOW, HOW DID I GET THE 2? 3 - 1? 1 + 1?

# IN MY CASE, I FORGET WHICH WAY I GOT TO THE ANSWER. SOLVE THIS BY TAKING A DEEP BREATH, GO THROUGH THE LINE OF CODE, ASK FOR A MINUTE 
# TO SCAN YOUR CODE, GATHER YOUR THOUGHTS, AND CREATE A MENTAL FRAMEWORK OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS IN YOUR CODE BEFORE EXPLAINING.

# WRITE COMMENTS IN A WAY THAT IT HIGHLIGHTS KEY PIECESE OF LOGIC, DONT OVERWRITE THEM. THIS LETS YOU READ THEM AND KNOW HOW TO EXPLAIN THINGS MORE EFFECIENTLY.
# Write a Python program to invert a dictionary with unique hashable values

# OUTPUT:
#{
